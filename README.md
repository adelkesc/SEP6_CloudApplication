## **Purpose** 
The purpose is to examine the concept of Cloud Computing and the strategic considerations for using Cloud Computing.  
 
## **About the project** 
The United Airplanes Association has hired you to create an application for them. The application will be used exclusively by a select few managers within the company. The managers need airport-related data readily available on their tablets, displayed through a web browser. The company is not interested in hosting the applications on their own premises. High uptime is essential, and the application must be available from anywhere with an internet connection and a web browser.
